        <h3>Discover Bourbon</h3>
        <p>Discover Bourbon is a recommendation and informational site about all things bourbon. Users can log into the website, leave reviews, and get recommendations based on their reviews. Users can also access an information page about each bourbon that describes the bourbon (i.e. proof, age, mash bill, distillery, etc.) as well as similar bourbons within and outside the same distillery. The website can be accessed and used to its full potential at <a href="https://discoverbourbon.herokuapp.com" style="text-decoration:none">discoverbourbon.herokuapp.com</a>. The website is missing many bourbons on market and is still under some finalization.</p>
        <p>This website was built using python, Django, HTML/CSS, sklearn, and is hosting on Heroku's VPS.</p>
